Define main(filename, mitigate_flag):
    Set the logging level for the network simulation to 'info'.
    Create a network topology that includes:
        - One switch
        - Two hosts (e.g., h1 and h2)
    Initialize the network simulation (using a tool like Mininet) with the created topology.
    Start the network.

    Retrieve the two host objects (h1 and h2).
    Obtain the IP addresses for h1 and h2.

    For host h2:
        Adjust kernel parameters:
            - Set the maximum SYN backlog value.
            - If mitigation is enabled (mitigate_flag is True):
                  Enable SYN cookies.
                  Set the number of SYN-ACK retries to a higher value.
            - Otherwise (if mitigation is disabled):
                  Disable SYN cookies.
                  Use a lower number for SYN-ACK retries.

    On h2:
        Launch the server (execute the server script) as a background process.

    On h1:
        Begin packet capture, saving the output to a file named using the provided filename.
        Start legitimate traffic by running a client script (legitimate.py) with h2â€™s IP address.

    Wait for 20 seconds (allowing the above processes to initialize).

    If mitigation is not enabled:
        On h1, modify firewall/iptables rules to drop outgoing TCP RST packets destined for h2 on port 8080.
    
    On h1:
        Initiate a SYN flood attack against h2 by executing a command (for example, using hping3) with specific parameters:
            - Set the count, packet size, SYN flag, and target port (8080).
        Display a message indicating that the SYN flood attack has started.

    Wait for 100 seconds to allow the attack to continue.
    
    Terminate the SYN flood attack process.
    Display a message indicating the attack has stopped.

    Wait for another 20 seconds.

    Terminate the legitimate traffic process.
    Display a message confirming legitimate traffic has stopped.

    Terminate the server process running on h2.
    Stop and clean up the network simulation.

Process command-line arguments:
    If the required arguments (filename and mitigation flag) are not provided:
         Display usage instructions and exit.
    Otherwise:
         Call main() with the parsed arguments.
         
If this file is executed directly:
    Execute the command-line argument handling.
